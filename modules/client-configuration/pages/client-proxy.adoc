= SLE Client Registration on a Proxy

////
The following sections cover registering Salt and traditional clients on a {productname} Proxy.
When a client is registered it connect to the proxy exclusively for Salt operations (Salt client) and normal HTTP package downloads.
There are three ways to register Salt clients.

Proxy servers can act as a broker and package cache for both traditional and Salt clients.
Registering clients on a {productname} Proxy is similar to registering them directly on {productname}, with a few key differences.

These sections contain information on registering Salt clients on a proxy using the {webui}, commands on the command line, or a bootstrap script.
There is also information on registering traditional clients using a bootstrap script.

// Here starts what you can see on the server about proxy connected clients

Within the {webui}, proxy pages will show information about both Salt and traditional clients.

You can see a list of clients that are connected to a proxy by clicking on the name of the proxy in menu:Main Navigation[Systems > Systems > Proxy], selecting the [guimenu]``Details`` tab, and then selecting the [guimenu]``Proxy`` tab.

A list of chained proxies for a Salt client can be seen by clicking on the name of the client in menu:Main Navigation[Systems > All], selecting the [guimenu]``Details`` tab, and then selecting the [guimenu]``Connection`` tab.

If you decide to move any of your clients between proxies or the server you will need to repeat the registration process from the beginning.
